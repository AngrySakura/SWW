# sleepwakewearable
Sleep wake classification using wearable devices (specifically using accelerometers, either triaxial or uniaxial and heart rate monitors). This repository aims to bring together most of the relevant approaches and algorithms used to date and incorporate them into simple pipelines to allow researchers to use them in their studies with ease. In doing so, we provide performance metrics and background on in which populations has the algorithm be successful on.
